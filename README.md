# Toxic_comments_Classification (Multilabel Classification)

# Overview
This project focuses on building a Toxic Comment Classification model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify text comments into toxic and non-toxic categories. The project achieves a remarkable 95% accuracy using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and the Count Vectorization method.

# Key Features
## High Accuracy: The model achieves a 95% accuracy rate in classifying toxic comments, making it a robust tool for identifying online toxicity.

## Count Vectorization: Text data is transformed into numerical features using the Count Vectorizer, enabling effective model training.

## Flask Web App: A user-friendly web application is built to allow real-time toxicity classification of user-input comments.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
Flask
pandas
numpy


# Model Training
The main model training and evaluation code can be found in the model_training.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. It includes data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation steps.
